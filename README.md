# Impact Client

Impact is an advanced Minecraft Utility Mod aimed towards user friendliness.
Here, you will be able to submit issues that prevent the client from performing as expected.

## Download

You can [download Impact][download] by visiting the Impact Website.

## Help and Support

If you need help using Impact, you should instead ask for it on the [discord] server. Use the `#help` channel so that you don't clutter up `#general` with support questions. Also make sure to check `#announcements`, pinned messages and use the search tool to see if your question has already been answered.

## Bugs

Please report any bugs you find [here][issues]. Try to be as descriptive as possible and make sure to check if the bug has already been reported _before_ reporting it youself. Please only report one bug per issue - if you have encountered multiple issues, report multiple bugs as seperate issues.

## Feature Requests

New features should also be reported as [issues]. Please try to describe the feature you are suggesting in as much detail as possible and explain _why_ it would be useful. As explained above, please first check the feature hasn't already been requested and make sure your issue only covers one feature. If you have multiple ideas, open seperate issues.
